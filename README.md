# Retail Therapy & Stress: Does Stress Encourage Shopping?

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between stress levels and spending habits to determine if people tend to spend more money when they are stressed. The study analyzes personal shopping behavior and external stress indicators to uncover any correlations between emotional state and consumer behavior.

## Motivation
Retail therapy is often seen as a way to cope with stress, but does stress actually lead to higher spending? This project aims to provide data-driven insights into whether stress levels influence spending patterns, and if so, in which categories (fashion, beauty, food, etc.).

## Data Sources

### 1. Personal Data (Primary Data Collection)
- **Spending Habits:** Tracking personal purchases (amount spent, category, impulse vs. planned buy).
- **Stress Levels:** Self-reported daily stress levels (1-10 scale) using a journal or stress-tracking app.
- **Shopping Motivation:** Logging shopping intent, including whether I wanted to shop and if I added something to my cart but later postponed the purchase.

### 2. Public Data (For Enrichment)
To supplement personal data, external datasets will provide broader context:

- **Retail Therapy Scale Development Studies**
  - Insights from *Retail Therapy: Scale Development* (Kang & Johnson, 2011) on shopping as a mood-alleviating behavior.  
    📄 [Read the study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254085102_Retail_Therapy_Scale_Development)
  - Validated survey data distinguishing retail therapy from impulse and compulsive buying.

- **Economic & Consumer Spending Trends**
  - *CES, FRED, World Bank, Statista:* Consumer spending patterns, inflation, and economic indicators.

- **Psychological Studies on Retail Therapy & Stress**
  - Research on shopping as a coping mechanism and its psychological drivers.

- **Stock Market Volatility (Stress Indicator)**
  - *VIX Index, financial reports:* Economic uncertainty’s impact on spending behavior.

## Data Collection Plan
✔️ Tracking personal data daily to capture spending habits and stress levels.  
✔️ Categorizing purchases into **fashion, beauty, entertainment, food, and essentials**.  
✔️ Enriching data with economic trends & external financial stress indicators.  
✔️ Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify spending trends during high and low stress periods.  
✔️ Applying **Machine Learning Models** to predict high-stress spending behavior.

## Planned Analysis & Techniques
🔹 **Correlation Analysis:** Checking if higher stress scores correspond with higher spending.  
🔹 **Time-Series Analysis:** Observing trends in spending patterns across different stress levels.  
🔹 **Clustering:** Identifying spending categories most affected by stress.  
🔹 **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing if spending significantly increases on high-stress days.  
🔹 **Predictive Modeling:** Using regression models to predict spending behavior based on stress levels.

## Expected Outcomes
✅ Identify whether stress leads to impulse purchases or increased spending.  
✅ Discover which product categories (**beauty, fashion, food**) are most affected by stress-driven shopping.  
✅ Determine if external stress factors (**economy, stock market**) influence retail therapy trends.
